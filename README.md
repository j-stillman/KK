Stop YouTube from pausing your sleep music

Do you listen to music on YouTube? Do you listen to music while you sleep?
If so, then you may be familiar with this little conundrum. After roughly an hour, YouTube will pause the video because you haven't been interacting with the page. This is understandable when you're listening in the daytime as they want to save bandwidth. But it's a big problem for me who wants to hear music playing when I go to bed, as well as when I wake up.

So what I did was simple: I created a Batch file to periodically press K to pause, then K to unpause. YouTube thinks you're engaging with the page, and voila! They won't pause your music!

It's not the most "refined" tool obviously, I just wanted to solve an immediate problem. Maybe I'll improve on it somehow later.
